This is our story...

We are Andrew Borg & Tijana Milenkovic.

We started our life journey in the field of architecture.We work as Architects and Interior designers.
We graduated with Master in Architecture, and completed Interior design course. 


Tijana discovered about Feng Shui and started education from the great Masters in that field. She completed <b> Master training at International Feng Shui School</b>, and <b>Master Practitioner Course with Lillian Too.</b>

We started using Feng Shui in life of people close to us, and we were amazed at how this ancient art works. We saw people change their finances, their job, relationships, found love partners, their health improved...

We decided to use our knowledge in architecture and design, to help people live wonderful lives and make their homes a sacred space where they love and want to be.

We decided with Feng Shui to help people live in joy, happiness, health, love, abundance, in the fullness of life.

We are happy to be here for you!
